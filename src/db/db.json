What graphic devices can be used or explored? How is movement translated into graphic form? Or duration? Or the stages of the activity? How does the audience interact with the diagram? What format or media best suits a diagram? Can a diagram work effectively in different cultures? Or without words? Can there be ambiguity within a diagram? These questions, and more, are to be explored, challenged and engaged with during the project."
